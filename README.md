# Python Scheduler

Goals & Extensions:

Our project seeks to create an application that improves the wedding planning process for married couples. Our app allows you to create and manage all of your wedding planning tasks by creating a personalized calendar.

As originally intended, our product will include a log-in page, which will save the user’s calendar and tasks. It will also include visual of their actual calendar and their tasks, which they can manually enter in. Users will be able to add the title of the task, a description, the date it is due, the number of hours the task will take, and the level of priority. After Python logs the user's preferences, the product will return a personalized calendar.

Our future goal & a possible extension of this project is to create a fully-functioning application that will provide couple’s with a platform to plan and create the wedding of their dreams. The application would assist couples by providing recommendations based on the user’s inputted information and will provide potential wedding venues, dining & catering options, wedding themes/color palettes, etc. The reason that this is our stretch goal is that it involves the creation of a large-scale database, and finding that information or scraping it from the web might be a process that we’re not yet capable of.

Our intentions for this project were primarily learning & development oriented. Considering that our group’s members are all at relatively similar programming levels, especially when it comes to Python, many of our goals & learning aspirations are the same. We wanted a project that helped us be comfortable with using Python as a means to solve problems & to create a project that demonstrates our learning & progress throughout the course.
